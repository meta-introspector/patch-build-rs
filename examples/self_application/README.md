# Self-Application Example

This example demonstrates the "automorphic" or "self-referential" capabilities of the `patch-build-rs` ecosystem. Here, we use the macros provided by the project to build the project itself.

## How it Works

1.  **`build.rs`**: The `build.rs` script in this example uses the `mkbuildrs!` macro to generate build-time information about the `patch-build-rs` project. It will generate `cfg` flags and other information that can be used by the `main.rs` file.

2.  **`src/main.rs`**: The `main.rs` file will then use the `cfg` flags generated by the `build.rs` script to print out information about the build environment.

This demonstrates a simple, practical application of the self-referential capabilities of the `patch-build-rs` system.
