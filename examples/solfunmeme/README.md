# SOLFUNMEME: The Zero Ontology System Example

This example demonstrates the metaprogramming capabilities of the `patch-build-rs` ecosystem through the lens of **SOLFUNMEME**, a conceptual, self-evolving meme protocol.

## The Concept

SOLFUNMEME is a "Zero Ontology System" (ZOS), a meta-protocol for memetic evolution. It's a self-referential system that generates and evolves its own meaning. The key features of SOLFUNMEME are:

-   **Self-Introspective Meme Engine**: The system can reflect on its own structure.
-   **Paxos Meme Consensus**: The rules of the meme's evolution are governed by a consensus mechanism.
-   **Hyper-Pump Mechanism**: The value of the meme is recursively defined by hype and engagement.
-   **Semantic Compression**: The meme's essence is encoded in a minimal, potent form.
-   **Immutable Meme-State**: The state of the meme is consistent and decentralized.

## The Implementation

This example uses the `patch-build-rs` macros to model the SOLFUNMEME protocol:

1.  **`build.rs` as the Meme-State Generator**: The `build.rs` script uses the `mkbuildrs!` macro to define the "Immutable Meme-State" of SOLFUNMEME. It sets `cfg` flags for each of the core features of the protocol and defines resource requirements for the "Meme Mining" process.

2.  **`src/main.rs` as the Meme Engine**: The main application uses the `cfg` flags generated by the `build.rs` script to "run" the meme protocol. It prints out descriptions of the active features, demonstrating that the "Meme-State" is being read and interpreted at compile time.

This example is a creative exploration of how `patch-build-rs` can be used to model complex, self-referential systems, even something as abstract as a "meme protocol."
