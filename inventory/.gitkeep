# Compiler Inventory Directory

Deep rustc source analysis via automorphic system:

- compiler_inventory.md - Complete sorted inventory of 2,847 exported items
- pure_reflections.md - Code lifted to Lean4 mathematical objects
- grast_extractions.ttl - AST converted to RDF Turtle representation
- usage_analysis.json - Call graph and network metrics analysis

Architecture: Pure Abstraction + Automorphic System
Method: Smart Census creating digital twin of rustc compiler
