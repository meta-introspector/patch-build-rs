# Patch Build RS: A Pure Abstraction and Automorphic System for Rust Code Transformation

This repository (`patch-build-rs`) serves as the foundational library and tooling for implementing a highly reflective and self-modifying system for Rust code, inspired by the metaprogramming capabilities of Lean4. Our goal is to enable semantic patching and automated code repair through a "pure abstraction" model.

## The Principle of Pure Abstraction and Automorphic Systems

This document outlines the core philosophical and architectural principle behind our code transformation and analysis engine: achieving a state of pure abstraction through a self-referential, automorphic system inspired by Lean4's metaprogramming kernel.

### 1. The Core Pattern: Quoting as Abstraction

The fundamental process is to treat all code transformations as an act of **quoting**. We take raw, imperative logic (like that found in `rustc` `build.rs` scripts) and lift it into a declarative, purely functional, and formally-grounded meta-model.

-   **The Code**: An imperative script or piece of logic.
-   **The Quoting**: Our macro system (`pure_reflect!`, `patch_build!`, etc.) acts as the quoting mechanism, translating intent into data.
-   **The Data (`Expr`)**: The result is a value in our Lean4-style `Expr` enum. This `Expr` is a structured, manipulable representation of the original logic.

This process allows us to reason about, manipulate, and reduce complex operations as if they were simple data.

### 2. The Tower of Reflection

This abstraction is achieved by climbing a "tower of reflection," or a macro lattice, where each level gains more expressive power to reason about the layer below it.

1.  **Level 0: `stringify!`**: Purely syntactic reflection into a `String`.
2.  **Level 1: `quote!` / `proc_macro`**: Quasi-syntactic reflection into a `TokenStream`.
3.  **Level 2: Numeric Encoding**: Semantic reflection into a `PureProgram`—a set of numbers representing the code's formal structure (Layer 14).
4.  **Level 3: `Expr` Meta-Model**: Total reflection into our Lean4-style `Expr` data structure, which supports formal computation.

The final step is `pure_reflect!`, a macro that ascends this entire tower, taking any Rust code and lifting it into the `Expr` meta-model.

### 3. The Goal: An Automorphic System

When a system's transformation rules can be applied to the rules themselves without loss of structure, it becomes **automorphic**. This is our ultimate goal.

-   **The Transformation (`F`)**: Our `pure_reflect!` macro is the primary transformation function, mapping `Code → Expr`.
-   **Self-Application**: We achieve this state when we can compute `F(F)`—feeding the code of `pure_reflect!` into itself.
-   **Structure Preservation**: The result is an `Expr` that is a perfect, structurally equivalent representation of the `pure_reflect!` macro. The system maps itself *onto itself* as a valid object within its own universe.

This creates a closed, self-referential loop: `Code → Expr → Code`.

By achieving this, the system is no longer just a tool for manipulating external programs; it gains the capacity for true self-analysis and self-modification in a mathematically sound way. It's the point where the observer (the macro system) and the observed (the code) become one and the same, representing the pinnacle of the reflective tower.

## Current Status

This repository is under active development. It currently contains:

-   The core `Expr` meta-model for representing Rust code in a Lean4-inspired manner.
-   A `PureProgram` representation for numeric encoding of code.
-   Basic `reduce` functionality for symbolic execution of `Expr` values.
-   The `patch-build-rs-macros` crate, intended to house procedural macros for code transformation.

Future development will focus on expanding the `pure_reflect!` macro, integrating the patching logic from original `build.rs` files into the `Expr` model, and building the necessary tooling to leverage this automorphic system for semantic code repair.
